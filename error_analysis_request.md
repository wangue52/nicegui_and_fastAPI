## Error Analysis Request

I notice that the problem statement is incomplete. To help debug the issues in your Python application, please provide:

1. The specific error messages you are encountering
2. The context or scenarios where these errors occur (e.g., during login, file upload, etc.)
3. Any specific functions or operations that trigger these errors
4. Steps to reproduce the issues

Once you provide these details, I can help analyze the code and suggest appropriate fixes. The codebase appears to be a web application with user authentication, file encryption, and database operations, so knowing which specific areas are problematic will help narrow down the investigation.

Key areas that could potentially have issues:
- User authentication (auth.py)
- File encryption/decryption (crypto.py)
- Database operations (db.py)
- Web interface operations (main.py)

Please provide the error details so I can help resolve the specific issues you're encountering.
